# Synth Songs
### Written with Sonic Pi 

I like writing songs using the language [Sonic Pi](www.sonic-pi.net).  Sonic pi is a coding language that exists simultaneously as
music, so you can copy anything from this repo, paste it into your own copy of sonic pi, and hear the song!  This is super
cool to me, so I wanted to share the snippets and sketches and finished songs I been working on!
